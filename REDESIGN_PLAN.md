# Plan to fix openclawtechnology.com style

1. **Modernize UI**: Replace the basic layout with a more sophisticated, "Next-Gen" tech aesthetic.
2. **Dark Mode / Sleek Colors**: Use deep blues, charcoal, and vibrant accents (indigo/cyan).
3. **Glassmorphism**: Add transparency and blur effects to cards and navigation.
4. **Improved Layout**:
   - Sticky sidebar for news and leaderboards.
   - Grid layout with better spacing for tool cards.
   - Animated interactions (hover effects, smooth transitions).
5. **Enhanced Hero Section**: Larger text, better gradients, and a clear call to action.

## Implementation Steps
- Update `template.html` with new Tailwind CSS structure and custom styles.
- Ensure `build.js` correctly populates the new placeholders.
- Commit and push changes to trigger GitHub Pages redeploy.
