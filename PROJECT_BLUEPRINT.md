# Project Blueprint: AI Review Next-Gen Hub

## Vision
To transform the current AI Review site into a world-class AI platform, taking design and structural cues from **ClickUp**. The goal is to move from a simple review site to a comprehensive AI "Operating System" for users to discover, learn, and track the AI industry.

## Inspiration: ClickUp.com
### Design System (The ClickUp Aesthetic)
- **Palette**: Clean white backgrounds with high-contrast vibrant accents (ClickUp Purple #7b68ee, Magenta, Cyan).
- **Typography**: Modern, rounded sans-serif (e.g., Axiforma or Inter) for a friendly yet professional tech feel.
- **Spacing**: Generous white space, large rounded corners (12px - 16px), and subtle shadows to create depth.
- **Layout**: "All-in-one" dashboard feel. Uses grid-based cards and sidebars for dense yet organized information.

## Information Architecture
### 1. AI News & Leaks/Rumors (The Pulse)
- **Layout**: List/Grid view with "hot" tags.
- **Features**: Source verification levels, "Trust Score", and community comments.

### 2. AI Tools Directory (Categorized)
- **Categories**: Image Gen, Video, Audio, Productivity, Coding, Research, etc.
- **Filters**: Pricing (Free/Paid/Freemium), API availability, Open Source status.

### 3. Best LLM Leaderboards
- **Free vs. Paid**: Side-by-side comparisons.
- **Metrics**: Speed, Reasoning, Creative Writing, Coding, and "Vibe" check.
- **Live Benchmarking**: Integration with open-source benchmarking tools.

### 4. Tutorials & Guides
- **OpenClaw Setups**: Deep dives into personal AI agent configurations.
- **API Integrations**: Practical "how-to" for developers.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: High-level summaries with expandable deep-dives.

### 5. Tech/Gadget Hub
- **Reviews**: Rabbit R1, Humane Pin, AI Laptops, etc.
- **Compatibility**: How well these gadgets work with various AI ecosystems.

## Design Goals
- **Dashboard First**: The homepage should feel like a command center.
- **Density with Clarity**: Use ClickUp-style "Everything View" to toggle between simple and detailed views.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states, smooth transitions, and "Super Agent" inspired helpers.
